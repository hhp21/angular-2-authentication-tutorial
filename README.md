# Daily Deals

Daily Deals is an application built with Angular that shows how you can add token based authentication using the [Implicit flow](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/concepts/implicit) to your Angular applications. You can read the full tutorial for this project here: [Angular Authentication Tutorial](https://auth0.com/blog/angular-2-authentication/).

# Running the App

You will need to run both the Node.js server located in the `server` directory and Angular front-end located in the `ng2auth` directory. See each of the project directories for detailed instructions on how to run the projects. You will need an Auth0 account, so if you don't already have one, [sign up](https://auth0.com/signup) for a free account today. 

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
